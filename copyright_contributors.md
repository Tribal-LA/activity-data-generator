## How to Contribute
Our hope is that anyone who improves this data generator will fork the Tribal-LA repository to make changes and issue Pull Requests to merge improvements back. Since Tribal will be using this code, it may be appropriate for forks to diverge, if your use cases differ, but we would like to try to avoid this. Where the changes are not just bug fixes and low-impact backwards-compatible enhancements, but are more substantial ideas for improvements, please raise an Issue to discuss the idea.

Feel free to contact adam.cooper@tribalgroup.com to share ideas, discuss, etc...
